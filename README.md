  Our hack provides the user a navigational interface similar to other popular navigation applications. However, what differentiates our project from many others is our implementation of truly live traffic analysis and lane suggestions. We use web-scrapers to collect the FDOT's publicly available traffic video-stream from the next three sequential cameras ahead of the user on their route. We then run a computer vision model to first identify the cars in the video, to then categorize which cars are driving in which lanes and estimate the speed of each car, after which we can compute an average speed for each lane at each traffic camera. We finally present this information to the user in our navigational app with a clear, clean, and intuitive UI.
